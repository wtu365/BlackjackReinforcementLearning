# BlackjackReinforcementLearning

By: Wesley Tu

This project was meant to learn more about the process of Q-value Reinforcement Learning, or Q-learning for short. This is the process in which a model learns the best actions to take at specific states. This is done through by learning Q-values, which are values that are mapped to specific state-action pairs. For this specific project, I wanted to recreate the basic strategy chart for Blackjack shown here:

Blackjack Rules I'm using:

- Dealer hits on a soft 17
- DAS (Double After Split) is allowed
- Late surrender is offered
- Blackjack is a 3 to 2 reward
