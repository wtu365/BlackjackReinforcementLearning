# BlackjackReinforcementLearning

By: Wesley Tu

This project was meant to learn more about the process of Q-value Reinforcement Learning, or Q-learning for short. This is the process in which a model learns the best actions to take at specific states. This is done through by learning Q-values, which are values that are mapped to specific state-action pairs. For this specific project, I wanted to recreate the basic strategy chart for Blackjack shown here:
